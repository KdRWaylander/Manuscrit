We studied visual search within this context and found a reduction in the size of the field as a function of age. This loss, however, was recovered partially with practice. Standard acuity and perimetric tests of visual field, although diagnostic of disease, underestimate the degree of difficulty experienced by visually healthy older adults in everyday activities requiring the use of peripheral vision. To aid in predicting such performance, a model incorporating the effects of distractors and secondary task demands was developed.},

	abstract = {The colour-matching functions of standard observers proposed by the CIE represent the normal colour vision for the worldwide population. But there are deviations in the colour-matching functions for real observers with a normal colour vision, so the observer metamerism index was defined by CIE to evaluate the mismatch between them in colour appearance. In this work, we present an alternative form to evaluate the differences between the CIE standard observer and real observers (Stiles-Burch database) according to the number of distinguishable colours in the colour solid associated to each observer. Unlike the metamerism index defined by CIE, we evaluate globally the colour appearance for a real observer taking into account its colour gamut volume. After analyzing the results, we have seen that the gamut volume of the real-observers is lower than to that associated to the CIE standard observer, even to that associated to the CIE modified observer. Therefore, this work and its methodology could be used to know the ability of the CMF's of different observers to get the maximum colour gamut under the same illuminant. Furthermore, this methodology could be applicable to study the gamut volume variability of the real observers regarding to age, race, etc, or even with abnormalities in colour vision (dichromacy, pathologies, etc).},

To clarify the situation, we measured contrast sensitivity functions on a large sample of adults (n = 91). ranging in age from 19 to 87. All observers were free from significant ocular pathology and were individually refracted for the test distance. Sensitivity for stationary gratings of low spatial frequency remained the same throughout adulthood. At higher spatial frequencies, sensitivity decreased with age beginning around 40 to 50 years. When a low spatial frequency grating was drifted, young adults' sensitivity improved by a factor of 4–5 over sensitivity to a static grating: this motion enhancement was markedly diminished in adults over 60 years, implying an impairment of temporal processing in the elderly. Reduced retinal illuminance characteristic of the aged eye could account for a large part of older adults' deficit in spatial vision, but appeared to play little role in their deficit in temporal vision.},

	abstract = {The field of algorithmically assessing the 3D quality of experience and/or 3D quality is an extremely challenging one; making it a fertile ground for research. The complexity of the problem, coupled with our yet nascent understanding of 3D perception and the increasing commercial shift toward 3D entertainment makes the area of 3D QA interesting, formidable and practically relevant. This article undertakes a brief review of the recent research in the area of 3D visual quality of experience and quality assessment. We first review literature in the field of quality of experience which encompasses geometry, visual discomfort etc., and then perform a similar review in the field of quality assessment which encompasses distortions such as blur, noise, compression etc. We describe algorithms and databases that have been proposed in the literature for these purposes. We conclude with a short description of a recent resource - the LIVE 3D IQA database that is the first quality assessment database which provides researchers with access to true depth information for each of the stereo pairs obtained from a high-precision range scanner. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

	abstract = {Stereoscopic/3D image and video quality assessment (IQA/VQA) has become increasing relevant in today's world, owing to the amount of attention that has recently been focused on 3D/stereoscopic cinema, television, gaming, and mobile video. Understanding the quality of experience of human viewers as they watch 3D videos is a complex and multi-disciplinary problem. Toward this end we offer a holistic assessment of the issues that are encountered, survey the progress that has been made towards addressing these issues, discuss ongoing efforts to resolve them, and point up the future challenges that need to be focused on. Important tools in the study of the quality of 3D visual signals are databases of 3D image and video sets, distorted versions of these signals and the results of large-scale studies of human opinions of their quality. We explain the construction of one such tool, the LIVE 3D IQA database, which is the first publicly available 3D IQA database that incorporates ‘true’ depth information along with stereoscopic pairs and human opinion scores. We describe the creation of the database and analyze the performance of a variety of 2D and 3D quality models using the new database. The database as well as the algorithms evaluated are available for researchers in the field to use in order to enable objective comparisons of future algorithms. Finally, we broadly summarize the field of 3D QA focusing on key unresolved problems including stereoscopic distortions, 3D masking, and algorithm development.},

	abstract = {Based on a representation of the receptive fields of the human retina, a mathematical model has been developed that describes the primary stage of the processing of visual information, taking into account the internal noise of the photoreceptors. The hypothesis is advanced that the visual perception power of an image is the result of the sum of the reactions of the ganglion cells to whose receptive fields the action of the stimulus propagates. Based on the proposed model, the contrast-sensitivity function (CSF) of the human visual system is calculated. It is shown that, for stimuli in the form of regular periodic gratings with alternating light and dark strips in the region of high spatial frequencies, the CSF has resonance minima whose spectral position and depth depend on the ratio between the sizes of the central and peripheral zones of the receptive fields.},

The first aim of this study was to verify if the same phenomenon occurs when driving is performed in a simulated road traffic situation. The second aim was to discover if this field also deteriorates as a function of the driver’s age and of the vehicle’s speed. Nine young drivers (from 22 to 34 years) and nine older drivers (from 46 to 59 years) followed a vehicle in road traffic during two two-hour sessions. The car-following task involved driving at 90 km·h−1 (speed limit on road in France) in one session and at 130 km·h−1 (speed limit on motorway in France) in the other session. While following the vehicle, the driver had to detect the changes in colour of a luminous signal located in the central part of his/her visual field and a visual signal that appeared at different eccentricities on the rear lights of the vehicles in the traffic. The analysis of the data indicates that the useful visual field deteriorates with the prolongation of the monotonous simulated driving task, with the driver’s age and with the vehicle’s speed. The results are discussed in terms of general interference and tunnel vision.},

In contrast to the attention mechanisms used in most previous machine vision systems which drive attention based on the spatial location hypothesis, the mechanisms which direct visual attention in our system are object-driven as well as feature-driven. The competition to gain visual attention occurs not only within an object but also between objects. For this purpose, two new mechanisms in the proposed model are described and analyzed in detail. The first mechanism computes the visual salience of objects and groupings; the second one implements the hierarchical selectivity of attentional shifts. The results of the new approach on synthetic and natural images are reported.},

The geometry of stereoscopic camera and display systems is presented first. This is followed by the analysis and diagrammatic presentation of various image distortions such as depth plane curvature, depth non-linearity, depth and size magnification, shearing distortion and keystone distortion. The variation of system parameters is also analyzed with the help of plots of image geometry to show their effects on image distortions. The converged (toed-in) and parallel camera configurations are compared and the amount of vertical parallax induced by lens distortion and keystone distortion are discussed. The range of acceptable vertical parallax and the convergence/accommodation limitations on depth range are also discussed. It is shown that a number of these distortions can be eliminated by the appropriate choice of camera and display systems parameters. There are some image distortions, however, which cannot be avoided due to the nature of human vision and limitations of current stereoscopic video display techniques.},

	abstract = {This book attempts to bring together, in a context-free manner, as far as possible, the rationale underpinning the development and practice of training. It is aimed at "students," in the widest sense, including not only undergraduates and postgraduates but also researchers and inquiring practitioners. The perspective adopted is a psychological one, although the book is intended as a text for students not only in psychology but also in ergonomics, human factors, education, business and management-related disciplines.  The view taken is that there are many texts concerned with the practical aspects of training but few which discuss its foundations and the evidence for and against what might loosely be termed "training principles and techniques." Also, providing the reader with prescriptions without their rationale can be problematic when some have to be selected and adapted for new training situations. Therefore this book reviews theoretical principles, techniques and accompanying evidence concerning the development of training. In so doing, it identifies and synthesises the content of psychology which is applicable to training and therefore of relevance to the practitioner.  A second issue concerns the disciplines and areas of psychology relevant to training. It is unfortunate that we are all prisoners of a society and educational system which reinforce boundaries between subjects. Indeed this is the very way in which we attempt to survive amidst an ever increasing bombardment of information and proliferation of "labels." Whilst this book does not overcome these problems, it does, in a limited way, bring together areas of both psychology and application which are not usual bed-fellows. One aim is to integrate ideas from cognitive psychology with those from the more traditional areas on which training draws; that of occupational/industrial psychology, human factors and ergonomics.

The book builds a foundation on the assumption that these systems are first and foremost human-centered technologies, in that their purpose is to complement and extend human capabilities across a wide variety of domains.},

	abstract = {The retinal image quality characterized by the modulation-transfer function of the eye was measured for two groups of subjects aged in the late twenties and mid sixties, respectively. In both groups, we obtained modulation transfer functions by using a double-pass method under the same experimental conditions: 4-mm artificial pupil, paralyzed accommodation, and objective control of the refractive state and centering. Results showed lower values of modulation in the retinal image for older subjects compared with the younger subjects. The modulation transfer function ratio is similar to that previously found for contrast-sensitivity measurements with subjects in the same age groups. These results suggest that a significant fraction of the loss in spatial vision with age has an optical origin. Apart from the well-known increase in intraocular scattering, there also appears to be an increment in ocular aberration that causes an additional reduction in the contrast of retinal images.},

	abstract = {Changes in the unaccommodated human crystalline lens were characterized as a function of subject age for 100 normal emmetropes over the age range 18–70 yr by Scheimpflug slit-lamp photography. With increasing age, the lens becomes thicker sagittally, but since the distance from the cornea to the posterior lens surface remains unchanged, this indicates that the center of lens mass moves anteriorly and the anterior chamber becomes shallower. Sagittal nuclear thickness is independent of age, but both anterior and posterior cortical thicknesses increase with age, shifting the location of the nucleus and the central sulcus in the anterior direction. The amount of light scattered by the lens at high angles, as represented by normalized and integrated lens densities from the digitized images, increases with increasing age in an exponential fashion. Similar relationships to age are observed for the major anterior zone of discontinuity (maximum density) and the central sulcus (minimum density). The relationships of these results to accommodation and presbyopia are discussed.},

The aim of this research is to quantify the role of VE scene content and resultant relative object motion on perceptual sensitivity to VE latency. Latency detection was examined by presenting observers in a head-tracked, stereoscopic head mounted display with environments having differing levels of complexity ranging from simple geometrical objects to a radiosity-rendered scene of two interconnected rooms. Latency discrimination was compared with results from a previous study in which only simple geometrical objects, without radiosity rendering or a 'real-world' setting, were used. From the results of these two studies, it can be inferred that the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) for latency discrimination by trained observers averages {\textasciitilde}15 ms or less, independent of scene complexity and real-world meaning. Such knowledge will help elucidate latency perception mechanisms and, in turn, guide VE designers in the development of latency countermeasures.},

We test the hypothesis that observers use “image slip” (i.e., motion of the VE scene caused by system time lags) to detect the consequences of latency rather than explicitly detecting time delay. Our presumption is that forcing observers to change from constant rate to randomly paced head motion will disrupt their ability to discriminate latency based on perceived image slip. This study indicates that the disruption in motion pattern causes a shift in latency detection criteria and a minor degradation in discrimination ability. It is likely therefore that observers make at least some use of image slip in discriminating VE latency. It can also be inferred that when observers learn to discriminate latency, their Just Noticeable Difference (JND) remains below 17 ms.},

Common commercial devices present with latency up to 125ms. Although these levels have been shown to impact users' perception of the responsiveness of the system [16], relatively little is known about the impact of latency on the performance of tasks common to direct-touch interfaces, such as direct physical manipulation. In this paper, we study the effect of latency of a direct-touch pointing device on dragging tasks. Our tests show that user performance decreases as latency increases. We also find that user performance is more severely affected by latency when targets are smaller or farther away. We present a detailed analysis of users' coping mechanisms for latency, and present the results of a follow-up study demonstrating user perception of latency in the land-on phase of the dragging task.},

SR fluctuates over time, so it must be described statistically with mean (MSR) and standard deviation (SDSR). In this paper, we examine SR in virtual environments (VEs), outlining its components and methods of experimental measurement and manipulation. Three studies of MSR and SDSR effects on performance of grasp and placement tasks are then presented. The studies used within-subjects designs with 11, 12, and 10 participants, respectively. Results showed that SDSR affected performance only if it was above 82 ms. Placement required more frequent visual feedback and was more sensitive to SR. We infer that VE designers need not tightly control SDSR and may wish to vary SR control based on required visual feedback frequency. These results may be used to improve the human-computer interface in a wide range of interactive graphical applications, including scientific visualization, training, mental health, and entertainment.},

End-end tracking latency (display lag) degrades this illusion of stability and has been identified as a major fault of existing virtual-environment systems. Oscillopsia refers to the perception that the visual world appears to swim about or oscillate in space and is a manifestation of this loss of perceptual stability of the environment. The effects of end-end latency and head velocity on perceptual stability in a virtual environment were investigated psychophysically. Subjects became significantly more likely to report oscillopsia during head movements when end-end latency or head velocity were increased. It is concluded that perceptual instability of the world arises with increased head motion and increased display lag. Oscillopsia is expected to be more apparent in tasks requiring real locomotion or rapid head movement.},

	abstract = {System latency (time delay) and its visible consequences are fundamental Virtual Environment (VE) deficiencies that can hamper user perception and performance. This paper presents an immersive simulation system which improves upon current latency measurement and minimization techniques. Hardware used for latency measurements and minimization is assembled based on low-cost and portable equipment, most of them commonly found in an academic facility without reduction in accuracy of measurements. A custom-made mechanism of measuring and minimizing end-to-end head tracking latency in an immersive VE is assembled. The mechanism is based on an oscilloscope comparing two signals. One is generated due to the head-tracker movement by a shaft encoder attached on a servo motor moving the tracker. The other signal is generated by the visual consequences of this movement in the VE using a photodiode attached to the computer monitor. Visualization and application-level control of latency in the VE was implemented using the XVR platform. Minimization processes resulted in almost 50\% reduction of initial measured latency. The description of the mechanism by which VE latency is measured and minimized will be essential to guide system countermeasures such as predictive compensation.},

The study was conducted to help determine how best to display aircraft location to a pilot. Three different depth cues (stereo 3-D, aerial perspective, and familiar object size), were investigated. Additionally, two levels of display density (13 or 25 aircraft) were evaluated. The results of the study indicated that the number of depth cues, which ranged from zero to three, affected the subject's ability to determine aircraft location. Display density also affected performance. However, the particular type of depth cue did not have a differential effect. In other words, it makes a difference if one or two depth cues are displayed, but not the particular cues used.},

Second, how does the effectiveness of these depth cues change as a function of the viewing distance? Six college-aged subjects were tested with each depth cue at both viewing distances. They were tested using a method of constant stimuli procedure and a modified Wheatstone stereoscopic display. Accuracies for perceptual match settings for all cues were very high (mean constant errors were near zero), and no cues were significantly more or less accurate than any others.

The 3-D images were presented on a Tektronix SGS 620 field-sequential stereoscopic CRT. Four sources of depth information (cue types) were combined factorially to construct exemplary 3-D images: Relative Size (angular subtense decreased with increasing depth); Disparity (binocular disparity varied from crossed to uncrossed with increasing depth); Interposition (closer figures overlapped ones farther away in depth); and Luminance (luminance decreased with increasing depth). Inclusion of each of the three monocular cues produced significantly faster depth judgments. However, there was a lack of significant response time effects associated with binocular disparity. Conversely, stereo presentations strongly improved ratings of subjective image quality. These data indicate that stereoscopic images may provide subjectively more compelling depth information than images containing only monocular cues. However, they also provide evidence for at least one limitation of stereoscopic display utility.},

(Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions:  the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

Five main types of 3D displays are thus defined –two of those new–, aiming to provide a taxonomy that is largely backwards-compatible, but that also clarifies prior inconsistencies in the literature. This well-defined outline should also enable exploration of the 3D display space and devising of new 3D display systems.},

No system achieves this instantaneously: changes in the depicted virtual environment are delayed from changes in the position of the objects being tracked. In this paper, a method is proposed to quantify this time difference, the end-to-end delay of the VR system. Two light-sensing devices and two luminance gradients are used to simultaneously encode the position of one tracked object and its virtual counterpart. One light-sensing device is attached to the tracked object and it captures light from the gradient in the physical environment. The other device captures light from the gradient in the virtual environment. A measurement is obtained by moving the tracked object repetitively (by hand) across the gradient. The end-to-end delay is the asynchrony between the signals generated by the two light-sensing devices. The results collected with oscillatory movements performed at different frequencies indicate that for some VR systems, the end-to-end delay might not be constant but could vary as a function of the oscillation frequency.},

	abstract = {User perceptual sensitivity to changes of system latency was tested in three simple virtual environments: one with only a foreground object, a second with only a background object, and a third that combined both of these elements. Prior psychophysical measurements of sensitivity, Just Noticeable Difference; and bias, Points of Subjective Equality, from our laboratory are confirmed with measurements in 13 subjects. Our measurements indicate that perceptual stability across a variety of virtual environments will require latencies less than 16 ms. We discount a possible explanation that the differences between our results and those from a study by Allison et al. could be related to a visual capture effect initially reported by L. Matin. Instead, the differences may be due to the type of psychophysical judgment rendered by the subjects and the degree to which subjects were instructed and practiced.},

	abstract = {Excessive end-to-end latency and insufficient update rate continue to be major limitations of virtual environment (VE) system performance. Beginning from a typical baseline VE in which a spatial tracker is polled to deliver data via an RS-232 interface at each update of a single application program, we examined a series of hardware and software reconfigurations with the aim of reducing end-to-end latency and increasing update rate. These reconfigurations included: (1) multiple asynchronous UNIX processes communicating via shared memory; (2) continuous streaming rather than polled tracker operation; (3) multiple rather than single tracker instruments; and (4) higher bandwidth IEEE-488 parallel communication between tracker and computer. Starting from an average latency of 65 msec and an update rate of 20 Hz for a standard 1000 polygon test VE, our most successful implementation to date runs at 60 Hz (the maximum achievable with our graphics display hardware) with approximately 30 msec average latency. Because our equipment and architecture is based on widely available hardware (i.e., SGI computer, Polhemus Fastrak) and software (i.e., Sense8 WorldToolKit), our techniques and results are broadly applicable and easily transferable to other VE systems.},

	abstract = {One of the critical determinants of the effectiveness and usability of interactive graphics simulations is the latency with which visual updates can be made based on input from interaction devices. High latency can diminish performance and can lead to simulator sickness. We demonstrate a new method for measuring latency using a standard video camera. The method is simple to configure, sensitive and rapid to use. This is in contrast to previous methods which required specialized equipment, were laborious or could only determine gross changes in latency. We attach a tracker to a pendulum and move a simulated image on the screen using the tracker positions. We video both the pendulum and simulated image together, and fit two sine curves, one to centre of motion of pendulum and one to the centre of motion of the simulated image. From the phase difference between these two sine curves we can determine latency changes significantly less than the frame rate of the camera. We demonstrate the method by comparing the latency of a two different systems for a CAVE™-like display.},

Contrast sensitivity to sinusoids can vary from 14 to 60 depending on the amount of average-luminance area or flank adjacent to the sinusoid. The influence of average-luminance flanks does not depend on the width of the flank, but does depend on the equivalent number of cycles of flank.},
